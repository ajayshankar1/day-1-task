						Objects 

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.

These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Javascript has 5 data types that are passed by value: Boolean, null, undefined, String, and Number. We’ll call these primitive types.

Javascript has 3 data types that are passed by reference: Array, Function, and Object. These are all technically Objects, so we’ll refer to them collectively as Objects.

Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. 

A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
